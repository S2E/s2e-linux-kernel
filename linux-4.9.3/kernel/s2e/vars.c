 * This is required because we cannot safely access the `current_task` variable
 * (arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c) directly, as it is a per-CPU global variable.
 * We therefore assume that S2E is being run on a single-CPU VM, and whenever a
 * context switch happens (in `__switch_to`) we update this `s2e_current_task`
 * to point to the newly running task.
 *
 * This then allows S2E to read the `current_task` data whenever it needs to
 * get the current PID.
